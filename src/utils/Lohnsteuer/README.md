# How to Add a New Tax Year

This guide includes instructions how to add a new tax year to the calculators API. It uses _year 2024_ as a tangible example.

## Generating Lohnsteuer File

### Prerequesites: Set Up Environment

1. Clone the latest version of [the generator repository](https://github.com/jenner/LstGen) on your local machine.
2. Activate your virtual environment and install the package in editable mode:
   ```bash
   # Create a new virtual environment
   python3 -m venv venv
   # Activate the virtual environment
   source venv/bin/activate
   # Install the package in editable mode
   pip3 install -e .
   ```
3. Check if a `2024_1` entry is included in the file `lstgen/pap.py`. If not, add the corresponding entry to let the generator know about the new tax year including the new XML pseudo codes:
   ```python
   PAP_RESOURCES = OrderedDict((
       ('2024_1', PapResource(
           '/interface/2024Version1.xhtml',
           '/javax.faces.resource/daten/xmls/Lohnsteuer2024.xml.xhtml'
       )),
   ))
   ```
4. Finally, follow the instructions below.

We can't use the global `lstgen` command, as it is may not be up-to-date with the latest tax year. Instead, we will use the local `lstgen` command from the cloned repository.

### Trigger Generator

After `lstgen` is installed, run the following command:

```bash
python3 -m lstgen -p 2024_1 -l javascript --class-name Lohnsteuer2024 --outfile Lohnsteuer2024.js
```

A new file `Lohnsteuer2024.js` will be created in the current directory.

### Preprocess generated file

Now, edit the generated file and prepend the following lines at the top, replacing the existing function declaration:

```ts
// eslint-disable-next-line ts/ban-ts-comment
// @ts-nocheck

import { BigDecimal } from './shims/BigDecimal'

export function Lohnsteuer2024(params = {}) {}
```

Also, delete the `module.exports` declaration at the end of the file.

Then, copy the generated file `Lohnsteuer2024.js` as `Lohnsteuer2024.ts` into the current directory.

## Insert Into Handler Logic

Adjust `/routes/calculator/gross-to-net-calculator.get.ts` by editing as follows.

First, add the import of the recently created file:

```ts
import { Lohnsteuer2024 } from './2024'
```

Then, add a new entry to the `INCOME_TAX_CLASSES` object map:

```ts
export const INCOME_TAX_CLASSES = {
  // ...
  2025: Lohnsteuer2025 as unknown as LohnsteuerInstance,
} as const
```

Done! The Calculators API can now be called with new tax year as query parameter.

Please note, that you might need to change some dropdown entries etc. in the frontend as well.
